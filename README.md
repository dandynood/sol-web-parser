A simple single page web application aim to test for four believed-to-be common design flaws in Solidity contracts. Built with Vue (browser style), Node.js Express, Bootstrap and utilizing the Truffle framework. 

Part of a study in a Masters By Research course in Swinburne Sarawak.

### Prerequisites

This web app requires the [Truffle development environment](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) to facilitate directories and compilation of Solidity files (.sol) to JSON build files used for testing. Truffle can be installed via the command: `npm install -g truffle`

### Setup

1. Simply clone this repository and run `npm install` at the root directory to install packages. 
2. Finally run `npm start` at the root directory where a Node Express instance will run at `localhost:8081`
