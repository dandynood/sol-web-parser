## Case Study Resources
Copies of contracts obtained from dApps around GitHub for the case study chapter of the thesis. These are used with the Code Parser to perform very basic benchmarking tests to help with development and evaluate the test cases' operations partially.
Some modifications have been made to update them to a more recent version of at least Solidity 0.4 and to avoid naming conflicts when compiling with Truffle and the Solidity compiler.

### Source of contracts
The following is GitHub repositories which are the source of the smart contracts obtained and used in our thesis, and the Solidity compiler version used to compile for testing (changed via the `truffle-config.js` file).
